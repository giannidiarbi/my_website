            Hi, I’m Gianni — welcome to my personal website! I’m passionate about the intersection of design, technology, and strategy. 
            I study business and information design, and I love finding creative ways to blend storytelling and data to make an impact. 
            This website highlights a bit about me and my interests in digital innovation and creativity.

            Most recently, I had the opportunity to participate in a case study with JPMorgan Chase’s Commercial Banking Innovation Development Program.
            Here, I explored how AI applications like ChatGPT could transform business models and improve customer engagement for real-world clients.
            I developed an AI-driven proposal for a real business problem, focusing on how automation and generative technology could enhance marketing efficiency and personalization.
            That experience deepened my interest in how emerging technologies can drive strategy and innovation in financial services and beyond.

            Outside of academics and professional experiences, I’m fascinated by how brands communicate visually and emotionally. 
            I enjoy working on projects that combine design thinking, analytics, and technology to solve real-world challenges. 
            Whether I’m analyzing data, managing digital campaigns, or brainstorming product ideas, 
            I love bringing creativity and structure together to make something meaningful.
